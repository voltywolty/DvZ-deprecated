What is DvZ?
--------------------

Dwarves vs. Zombies is a gamemode that was thought of by Rurikar22 aka Rob. Dwarves build a keep to protect their core. There are 5 dwarf classes: Alchemist, Baker, Blacksmith, Builder, and Tailor. Each class is useful for every single dwarf. The dwarfs have one full night to build a keep before a dragon comes in to cause some chaos. Once the dragon is destroyed, monsters spawn to attack the keep. Monsters win by either killing all of the dwarves, or if the dwarves have ran out of time.

What does each class do?
--------------------

Here is what each class does.

* **Alchemist - An Alchemist crafs potions. It's recommended they set up shop near a blacksmith as they will provide them with redstone needed to make potions. Alchemists can transmute with their books if they have 4 mundane potions. Transmuting will allow them to either get healing potions, speed potions, or strength potions, as well as sand, a milk bucket, and bones.**

* **Baker - A Baker creates food. They make cakes and cookies to satisfy the dwarves' hunger! Transmuting using bricks can get them cakes, cookies, and more clay.**

* **Blacksmith - A Blacksmith creates tools. They should settle near tailors as they supply them with gold ore needed to create tools. Blacksmiths can transmute using their book if they have 3 clocks to either get a diamond sword, pickaxe, axe, or shovel. Transmuting also gets them redstone, a bow, arrows, dirt, and coal.**

* **Builder - A Builder is the most common class. Builders are the ones to build a keep to protect fellow dwarves. Transmuting can get them any kind of stone bricks and glowstone dust to light up the keep.**

* **Tailor - A Tailor provides better armor for the dwarves. Tailors are recommended to set up near alchemists as they provide them with bonemeal. Tailors can transmute with their book if they have at least 10 orange dye. Transmuting can get them a random piece of diamond armor.**
