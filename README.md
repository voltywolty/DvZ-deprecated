# Dwarves vs. Zombies

Dwarves vs. Zombies is a large scale role-playing game. MC Evolved games will start when there is at least 10 players, however, if it is not met, a staff member can start a game manually. 

When the game beings, all players spawn as a dwarf and their task is to gather supplies, weapons, and fortify their keep for the coming invasion. The dwarves will have one Minecraft day to prepare for the invasion. The dwarves ultimate goal is to defend their shrines from the oncoming hordes of monsters - however, they will fall eventually. The hordes are endless, and the dwarves are few. Additionally, dwarves cannot respawn - once dead, they become a monster.

As night falls, a small amount of dwarves will be randomly selected to die or partake in an event. The most common event being the plague. The goal of the monsters is to destroy all the dwarven shrines. It is very difficult for most monsters to fight a dwarf in single combat - monsters must rely on numbers to overwhelm and destroy the dwarves. As more dwarves are killed, the ranks of the monsters will grow and the dwarves will be forced to retreat. Eventually, the monsters will overwhelm the first shrine, which will move their spawn up to that point, forcing the dwarves to fall back to the next shrine. This process repeats until the last shrine is destroyed. The game ends when all the dwarves are dead or all the shrines have been destroyed.
